### Payroll Entry 

- Payroll is the sum total of all compensation a business must pay to its employees for a set period of time or on a given date.

### Steps Followed by us for Creating employee Salary are

- Basic Pay of employee as per college pay scale.
- Add 5% Interim Relief in Basic pay.
- Adding Dearness allowance 142% in Basic Pay.
- Medical Allowance,CCA,PF(10%),HRA.
- These all are Earning in salary.
- Then we add Deduction component like PF(20%),Development tax, GI, SML, SMAF.
- By calculating all Earning & Deduction, we get Net Paid Amount. 
- First we create salary component which are fixed these are declared in Salary Component.
- Next Create Salary Structure in which we group all Salary Component which are earning and deduction components.
- Setting up formula on Basic Pay like calculate IR(5%), ADA(142%) etc.
- After Successfully creating salary structure assigning it to employee where we define the Basic pay of Employee.
- At last in Salary Slip we select employee to whom we assign salary then salary structure automatically fetched and calculate base salary. 

### Adding bus Fee in Fee doctype of erpNext

- By default we have Fee component in which all fee categories are fetched but as per our requirement we need to add bus fee which is different for each student.
- For which First we create two doctype one in which Route detail with Fees is stored and second is child doctype called Bus component which is fetched in Fee doctype.
- Then Apply changes in Bus component like fetch value from Route detail doctype.
- For calculating total bus component and fee component we have to write some code in fee.js file.

```js
calculate_total_amount: function(frm) {
	var grand_total0 = 0, grand_total1 = 0, grand_total = 0;

	for(var i=0;i<frm.doc.components.length;i++) {
		if( frm.doc.components[i].amount >= 0){
			grand_total0 += frm.doc.components[i].amount;
		}
		else{
			grand_total0 = 0;
		}
	}

	if(frm.doc.bus_components.length == 0)
	{
		grand_total1 = 0;
	}
	if(frm.doc.bus_components.length >= 1)
	{
	for(var i=0;i<frm.doc.bus_components.length;i++) {
		if( frm.doc.bus_components[i].amount > 0){
			grand_total1 += frm.doc.bus_components[i].amount;
		}
		else{
			grand_total1 = 0;
		}
	}
	}
	grand_total = grand_total0 + grand_total1;
	console.log(grand_total)
	frm.set_value("grand_total", grand_total);
}

frappe.ui.form.on("Bus Component", {
	amount: function(frm) {
		frm.trigger("calculate_total_amount");
	}
});
```

### Make changes for in fee files to save data at backend

- First write code in api.py file create whitelist() where we use condition if bus component available.
- Then use it in Javascript file as function where we call api.py and sending data field data to function.
- Now in fee.py we calculate the bus component in loop and send grand total in database throught which we succesfully generate receipt with correct calculations.

### Noticeboard App

- In First approach we decide to use create doctype and apply workflow on it.
- Where all states are defined like Approve by hod, Draft etc.
- We allote Department to their Respective Hod and Clerk  So that they are able to create notice.
- Every thing Works fine but When we apply some code then workflow states create problem. eg data is saved but changes apply with delay.
- We find workflow also make task for app difficult because its file is not created inside the app that why it portability is difficult.
- So we decide to work without workflow also learn new things from mistakes.
- Assigning department to Hod & Clerk to one department in User Permission List.
- We use condition like cse = department_name.
- Department_name is fetched from doctype use function self.fieldname.
- After apply such condition we use make_autoname function.
- self.name = make_autoname('NOTICE-'+'CSE'+'/'+'.YYYY.'+'/'+'.#####')
- This function return series 'NOTICE-CSE/2022/00001'

**Fetching HOD by using variables in query**
```py
department = self.department
requiredRole = "Hod" 
		
		self.hod = frappe.db.sql(f""" select full_name 
			from `tabUser` 
			where `email` IN (select user 
			from `tabUser Permission` 
			where `for_value`="{department}" AND `user` IN (select parent 
			from `tabHas Role` 
			where `role`="{requiredRole}" )) """)
```

- By using this query with variable we are able to use this for all departments.
